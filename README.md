## Machine Learning University: Accelerated Tabular Data Class

This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __datasets__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Accelerated Tabular Data__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with tabular data (spreadsheet-like tables), learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques for tabular data, and apply them to real-world problems.

## Course Overview
There are three lectures and one final project for this class.
| Lecture 1 | Lecture 2 | Lecture 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Introduction to ML | Feature Engineering | Optimization |
| Sample ML Model | Tree-based Models | Regression Models |

__Final Project:__ Practice working with a "real-world" tabular dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab/tree/master/data/final_project). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-tab/blob/master/notebooks/MLA-TAB-Lecture1-Final-Project.ipynb).
